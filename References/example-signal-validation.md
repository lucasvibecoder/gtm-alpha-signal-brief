# Example Signal Validation: Landscape Estimator Job Postings Open 60+ Days

This reference shows how to validate an individual signal hypothesis from a GTM Alpha brief using real data. The signal tested: **landscape estimator job postings that remain open 60+ days on Indeed and other job boards** — used as evidence of estimating capacity constraints at commercial landscape contractors.

## Research Method

Validated using Perplexity AI (sonar-pro model) across multiple queries targeting Indeed, ZipRecruiter, Glassdoor, and BLS data. Cross-referenced with web search for specific company examples.

## Specific Examples Found

### BrightView Landscapes (Strongest Example)

BrightView, the largest U.S. landscape company, has **37 Senior Estimator** and **60 total Estimator** positions open across ZipRecruiter alone.

- **Specific posting:** Estimator - Landscape Construction, **Elmsford, NY**, **$80K–$115K/year**
- Listed simultaneously on Indeed, ZipRecruiter, and Glassdoor
- BrightView appears to be *perpetually hiring* estimators across dozens of locations — this isn't one stale posting, it's a structural inability to fill the role at scale

### Additional Examples (Dallas, TX Metro — Early 2026)

| Company | Location | Salary | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| **Lambert Landscape Company** | Dallas, TX 75247 | $85K–$90K/year | Requires 3–5+ years in residential landscape construction estimating |
| **Earthtones Companies** | Midlothian, TX 76065 | $65K–$80K/year | Estimating Auditor Landscape role focused on QC in landscape estimating |
| **Waterton Construction** | McKinney, TX 75069 | $55K–$60K/year | Jr. Estimator / Entry Level supporting preconstruction |

### Glassdoor Aging Data

Of ~150–200 active landscape estimator listings on Glassdoor, **47 are marked as 30+ days old** — roughly **25% of all open positions** aging past one month.

## Estimated Annual Volume

| Metric | Number |
|--------|--------|
| Active postings at any time (Indeed alone) | ~488 |
| Active on Glassdoor | ~150–200 |
| Marked 30+ days old (Glassdoor) | ~47 (25% of total) |
| BrightView estimator roles alone | 60 |
| **Estimated annual postings (all US job boards)** | **8,000–12,000** |

The 8K–12K annual estimate accounts for ~700–1,000 new postings/month nationally, seasonal peaking in Q1–Q2, ~20–30% overlap across boards, and a 3–6 month average listing lifespan for this role.

## Supporting Macro Data

### Bureau of Labor Statistics — Cost Estimators (SOC 13-1051)

- ~220,000 cost estimators employed in the U.S., ~40% in construction
- 5% job growth projected 2023–2033
- Median wage: $74,240 (higher in construction at ~$80K+)
- ~22,000 annual openings from replacements and growth

### Construction Labor Shortage Data

- **92% of contractors** report difficulty filling positions (AGC survey, August 2025)
- **306,000 construction jobs unfilled** as of July 2025
- **70% of landscape professionals** plan wage increases in 2026, with 44% increasing by 4%+
- Construction industry needs ~349,000–499,000 additional workers in 2026

## Confidence Assessment

| Finding | Confidence | Reasoning |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| BrightView has 37–60 estimator roles open right now | **High** | Confirmed across multiple job boards (ZipRecruiter, Indeed, Glassdoor) |
| ~25% of Glassdoor landscape estimator listings are 30+ days old | **Medium** | Reported by Perplexity but without direct source citations |
| 8,000–12,000 annual postings | **Medium** | Derived estimate from point-in-time snapshots, not historical data |
| Specific "60+ day old" named posting | **Low** | Job boards obscure exact posting dates in search results; the Ruppert Landscape example (42 days, Chantilly, VA) was reported by Perplexity but could not be independently verified |

## Implications for GTM Motion

The signal is **strongly validated at the macro level**. Key takeaways:

1. **The landscape estimator hiring market is structurally undersupplied.** BrightView alone with 60 open estimator roles proves that even the largest player can't fill these positions.

2. **A quarter of all listings go stale past 30 days.** This confirms the role is genuinely hard to fill, not just high-volume.

3. **The more actionable signal may be *any* landscape estimator posting** — not just 60+ day stale ones. Even a fresh posting proves the company is capacity-constrained and willing to spend $75K–$115K/year to solve it, which is Bobyard's exact wedge.

4. **Outreach angle:** "You've been trying to hire an estimator for 2 months. For less than that salary, Bobyard gives your existing team the capacity of 3 estimators — starting this week, not in 3 months when you find someone."

## How to Reproduce This Validation

To validate other signals from a GTM Alpha brief, follow this pattern:

1. **Define the signal precisely** — what observable indicator, where it appears, and what threshold matters
2. **Search for specific named examples** — company name, location, date, details
3. **Quantify the volume** — how many instances exist at any given time, and annually
4. **Cross-reference with macro data** — BLS, industry surveys, trade publications
5. **Assess confidence honestly** — separate what you confirmed from what you inferred
6. **Derive the GTM implication** — what does this mean for outreach timing, message, and motion type
